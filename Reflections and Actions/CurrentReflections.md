## Critical Research (15/09/2020)
After briefly covering what is going to be expected of us in the upcoming assignments, I have discovered that I will need to improve my research skills from undergraduate level. 
* Research needs to be done **critically**, taking into consideration both sides of an academic argument (possibly more than 2 sides of an argument). The differing views of the argument need to be compared and contrasted before I reach a decision and I need to fully explain why I decide to agree with a certain view point. 

> Revisit this point during my work on the assignment, and once I believe I have finished it. Is my work taking into account multiple sides of the argument? Is my reasearch up to date and meaningful? Have I considered all the angles?
