## Learning Theories (05/10/2020)
---
There are many different theories on how children learn, I should analyse lessons that I am obvserving to see how these learning theories are put into practice through activities that have been planned for the lessons. 

> Revisit this once I have had some more experience both observing and planning lessons to see if I have put these learning theories into place.

## Academically More Able (27/11/2020)
---
Extension tasks and driving the more able students is more complicated than just giving them more work to do. How do we capture their desire to learn more on the subject and help them grow?

> Try focusing on developing some of these extension tasks for the more able students in my classes, where do they want to explore?

## What is Education (18/09/2020)
---
We spent the day discussing what education is, what the education system aims to achieve and the different aspects of education in general.
* Education at a first look focuses on the attainment of knowledge, and then the assessment of that knowledge to ensure retention. However there are more sides to the education system than just the improvement of academia. After the discussions and topics covered today I believe that the social side of education is perhaps equally important to the subject knowledge being taught. The ability to function in a social heirachy, follow rules/directions and work as part of a team and individually are all skills that the big wide world after school has finished rely on. 

> This second side to the education system has definitely changed my outlook on teaching as a profession. The joke that teachers are glorified babysitters is possibly quite accurate, if a little crude and derogatory. Ensuring the social development of the students in school and through mediums such as afterschool clubs warrants more attention than first thought. I should revisit this idea once I have some classroom experience to see if this is evident in teachers behaviour in school.
