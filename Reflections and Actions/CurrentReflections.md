## Learning Theories (05/10/2020)
---
There are many different theories on how children learn, I should analyse lessons that I am obvserving to see how these learning theories are put into practice through activities that have been planned for the lessons. 

> Revisit this once I have had some more experience both observing and planning lessons to see if I have put these learning theories into place.
