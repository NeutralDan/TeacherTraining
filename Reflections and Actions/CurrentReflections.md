## What is Education (18/09/2020)
We spent the day discussing what education is, what the education system aims to achieve and the different aspects of education in general.
* Education at a first look focuses on the attainment of knowledge, and then the assessment of that knowledge to ensure retention. However there are more sides to the education system than just the improvement of academia. After the discussions and topics covered today I believe that the social side of education is perhaps equally important to the subject knowledge being taught. The ability to function in a social heirachy, follow rules/directions and work as part of a team and individually are all skills that the big wide world after school has finished rely on. 

> This second side to the education system has definitely changed my outlook on teaching as a profession. The joke that teachers are glorified babysitters is possibly quite accurate, if a little crude and derogatory. Ensuring the social development of the students in school and through mediums such as afterschool clubs warrants more attention than first thought. I should revisit this idea once I have some classroom experience to see if this is evident in teachers behaviour in school.

## Critical Research (15/09/2020)
After briefly covering what is going to be expected of us in the upcoming assignments, I have discovered that I will need to improve my research skills from undergraduate level. 
* Research needs to be done **critically**, taking into consideration both sides of an academic argument (possibly more than 2 sides of an argument). The differing views of the argument need to be compared and contrasted before I reach a decision and I need to fully explain why I decide to agree with a certain view point. 

> Revisit this point during my work on the assignment, and once I believe I have finished it. Is my work taking into account multiple sides of the argument? Is my reasearch up to date and meaningful? Have I considered all the angles?
