# Archived/Completed Reflections & Actions

### Workflow Solution (11/09/2020)
* Allan introduced Markdown files stored on GitHub as a workflow solution, this sounds like a great idea so i'm going to investigate and try to setup my own solution. 
    * This worked great! The 2 Markdown documents I have setup and linked to my GitHub repository should make it easy for Allan and my colleagues to see my reflections!#

### Screen Capture (11/09/2020)
* Allan gave some examples of software that are easy to use to enable us to capture our screens and webcams/microphones. This will be useful for online teaching solutions.
    * Added the Screencastify extension to Google Chrome that is very simple to use and can upload my screen captures/vlogs straight to youtube! I have also setup a private youtube channel for the teacher training course where I can post videos and link Allan and colleagues to.

### Demo my screen capture experience! (11/09/2020)
* Allan has requested a short video showing how I have decided to construct my reflections workflow for this year, this will get me to test out my screen capture skills and give me an idea of what recording a lesson for online learning would be like!
    * I have done it! You can follow [This link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0rJ7j4MGhg&t=2s&ab_channel=DanWTeacherTraining) to see a demo of my workflow solution!

### Previous Students Reflections (11/09/2020)
* Allan has provided a link where we can read comments from previous students about the course, these should give me some insight about what to expect from this year.
    * After reading through these comments, I can see where these previous students have found difficulties in their ITT year. There is some good advice in here for how to not get overwhelmed with the workload from the university and how to get more comfortable when teaching a class for the first time. This has helped me set some expectations about what my first steps into my school placement might be like! If I ever want to refer back to these comments, [they can be found here](https://github.com/calaldees/teachingWorkshops/blob/master/teacherTraining/_advice_from_past_students.md)

### Explore the backlash and confusion about computer science in education and wider society (11/09/2020)
* Allan has set us some background reading on the confusion about computer science in education and wider society, this sounds intriguing as I do not know much about this! He provided links to some articles that may be of interest:
    * [Coding the curriculum: new computer science GCSE fails to make the grade 2017](https://theconversation.com/coding-the-curriculum-new-computer-science-gcse-fails-to-make-the-grade-79780)
        * This article mentions that many students find computer science topics like programming irrelevant to them - why might this be? - Missing link between how these skills will translate into real world impact.
        * The main issue this article has with the computer science GCSE seems to be the lack of specialisation. Perhaps if the GCSE were split into 2 like Programming and Digital Literacy this would solve the issue? - But then what was the point of combining computing and ICT in the first place?
    * [Backlash against computing curriculum misses the point 2014](https://theconversation.com/backlash-against-computing-curriculum-misses-the-point-22380)
        * This article raises issues about the lack of teachers involvement in the change in the curriculum when it switched to computer science. This may be why the curriculum is weighted more towards programming, trying to sway younger generations into becoming programmers perhaps?
        * The issue is also mentioned at the way that english is still taught without the use of the internet as tool. This may have been addressed as Allan mentioned that source analysis has been moved into the computer science curriculum.
    * [Rotten STEM: How Technology Corrupts Education](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/)
        * This article immediately raises the question of if the growth of technology in schools is to more directly train students in "job skillS" so they can be economically active, rather than guiding them into being "flourishing humans". Perhaps the pursuit of knowledge is no longer an acceptable outlook on the purpose of academia?   
        * Claims are made that technology in the classroom actually negatively affects students grades and that students these days know much less about the natural sciences in favour of being technologically proficient. - This is probably more useful in todays society but is it worth the "loss" of knowledge in other areas?
        * The increase of technology as a resource in schools is perhaps widening the class divide in students, with less economically privileged coming out worse due to not having easy access to the required hardware/software for the course. - Could more funding help solve this problem?
    * [Internet use reduces study skills in university students](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200117085321.htm)
        * This article focuses on the impact that "internet addiction" have had on students mental wellbeing and motivation to study. Is digitising the education system going to have negative impacts if it goes to far? This highlights that the social side of education is perhaps just as important as the academic side.
 
>These articles have raised some very interesting questions   and presented some worrying arguments. This should be revisited later in the course to see if any of the points raised here can be addressed. 
> * The Rotten STEM article raises a good point that is academically valid, but the way technology is becoming more prolific is most likely a good thing. Society has become a hybrid of human and technological interaction so technological interaction is becoming more important! (15/09/2020)

## Microteach Improvements (22/10/20)
---
First experice of microteaching, first half was good with good examples that the students could relate to. Second half was too off task and should have continued to focus on the sequencing by adding a task to demonstrate their understanding of sequencing. The precise instructions stuff should have been for the next lesson or at least the second half of the microteach if it had been and hour. 

> Need to focus more on the lesson objective and add simpler tasks with less room for missinterpretation. The examples I used were good as they had context the students could draw upon but the tasks left too much for the students to do and should have been more focused.

## Behaviour Management (09/10/202)
---
Behaviour managagement is 90% pro-active. Putting this into place in the classroom is going to be difficult but is very important for maintaing control of a classroom.

> How can this be done? Visit this idea during lesson planning to make sure that I have included behaviour management routines into the lesson plan. 
> Setting expectations of classroom behaviour seems to be the main way to get the children to build up a respectful attitude to you as a teacher. Also buliding relationships with the students so that they know that you are going to help them grow makes behaviour control easier.

## Critical Research (15/09/2020)
---
After briefly covering what is going to be expected of us in the upcoming assignments, I have discovered that I will need to improve my research skills from undergraduate level. 
* Research needs to be done **critically**, taking into consideration both sides of an academic argument (possibly more than 2 sides of an argument). The differing views of the argument need to be compared and contrasted before I reach a decision and I need to fully explain why I decide to agree with a certain view point. 

> Revisit this point during my work on the assignment, and once I believe I have finished it. Is my work taking into account multiple sides of the argument? Is my reasearch up to date and meaningful? Have I considered all the angles?
> Taking multiple approaches to the research and discussing the ideas within my formative assessment essay worked well - hopefully the mark reflects this!

## Knowledge Audit
---

There are still some gaps in my knowledge:
* HTML, ASCII and some binary maths are the key areas I need to improve my knowledge in. 

> Work on these areas of knowledge before I need to teach them!
> Knowledge audit covers these gaps and how I am dealing with them!
