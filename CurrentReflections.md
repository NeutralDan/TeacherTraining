### Explore the backlash and confusion about computer science in education and wider society (11/09/2020)
* Allan has set us some background reading on the confusion about computer science in education and wider society, this sounds intriguing as I do not know much about this! He provided links to some articles that may be of interest:
    * [Coding the curriculum: new computer science GCSE fails to make the grade 2017](https://theconversation.com/coding-the-curriculum-new-computer-science-gcse-fails-to-make-the-grade-79780)
        * This article mentions that many students find computer science topics like programming irrelevant to them - why might this be? - Missing link between how these skills will translate into real world impact.
        * The main issue this article has with the computer science GCSE seems to be the lack of specialisation. Perhaps if the GCSE were split into 2 like Programming and Digital Literacy this would solve the issue? - But then what was the point of combining computing and ICT in the first place?
    * [Backlash against computing curriculum misses the point 2014](https://theconversation.com/backlash-against-computing-curriculum-misses-the-point-22380)
        * This article raises issues about the lack of teachers involvement in the change in the curriculum when it switched to computer science. This may be why the curriculum is weighted more towards programming, trying to sway younger generations into becoming programmers perhaps?
        * The issue is also mentioned at the way that english is still taught without the use of the internet as tool. This may have been addressed as Allan mentioned that source analysis has been moved into the computer science curriculum.
    * [Rotten STEM: How Technology Corrupts Education](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/)
        * This article immediately raises the question of if the growth of technology in schools is to more directly train students in "job skillS" so they can be economically active, rather than guiding them into being "flourishing humans". Perhaps the pursuit of knowledge is no longer an acceptable outlook on the purpose of academia?   
        * Claims are made that technology in the classroom actually negatively affects students grades and that students these days know much less about the natural sciences in favour of being technologically proficient. - This is probably more useful in todays society but is it worth the "loss" of knowledge in other areas?
        * The increase of technology as a resource in schools is perhaps widening the class divide in students, with less economically privileged coming out worse due to not having easy access to the required hardware/software for the course. - Could more funding help solve this problem?
    * [Internet use reduces study skills in university students](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200117085321.htm)
        * This article focuses on the impact that "internet addiction" have had on students mental wellbeing and motivation to study. Is digitising the education system going to have negative impacts if it goes to far? This highlights that the social side of education is perhaps just as important as the academic side.
  > These articles have raised some very interesting questions   and presented some worrying arguments. This should be revisited later in the course to see if any of the points raised here can be addressed.
