# Notes From Lectures (Week 2 - How do we teach?)

### Induction 2a (14/09/2020) 
* 3 Main takeaway points from induction session 2a:
  * What it means to be a professional and what professionalism means.
  * The importance of "contracting" with your mentor in school so that both parties understand what is expected of the relationship.
  * The role of both the mentor and mentee in the relationship, both work as a partnership and should be equally respectfull and attentive.

### Subject Pedagogy 2 (15/09/2020)
* We explored how different parties involved in the education system have different view points:
    * Students expect to be able to understand everything and be experts in the field easily. - Setting expectations in the classroom will be important here so that students understand that they are starting at the bottom and will not be creating AAA games at the end of the course.
    * Society expects you to train people to be workers and use technology effectively. - This links to the Rotten STEM article where maybe some of the deeper knowledge is being lost as it does not directly impact society in an economic point of view.
    * As teachers we expect to prepare the students for the future and provide them with the tools they will need in life, specifically within the field of computer science. - I need to understand that I will have some bias as to which areas of computing I will focus my teaching on, but still need to teach the entire curriculum fairly.   

* New students are in general, not very technologically competent. They may have expereince using phones and tablets but may not have used a keyboard and mouse ever. Simply logging on to the school computers for the first time may be a challenge. - I will have to be aware of the vast difference in prior knowledge between myself and the students, as well as different subsets of the students themselves!
* Classical/traditional computing compared to modern computing, what is the difference and how have things changed? - Traditional computing are things like logic gates, binary maths and algorithm design. These fundamental techniques are the underlying foundations to the modern computing ideas like voice activation, AI and data science. when teaching, trying to give examples that the students can draw reference from when teaching the fundamentals may be much more difficult now that the modern computing techniques are much more abstracted.
* **Threshold concepts** and Liminal space - Threshold concepts like loops and IF statements require full understanding before they can move on to some of the other curriculum. Liminal space is the students taking time to understand the threshold concepts fully before moving on.
* A unique mindset is required for computer science teachers - 
  * We need to have a **growth focused** mindset (i.e anyone is capable of anything if you try hard enough). 
  * We also need to encourage the students to find new stratagies and approaches to problems, so that they become better problem solvers. 
  * Lastly we need to emphasise the importance of feedback, and using high quality constructive feedback to inform the students of how they can improve.
* When teaching programming, taking an approach in the format:  
 **use > modify > create**  
 works well. Get them to use some code to understand it, then they can modify part of it to see how it works, then get them to create their own. Also starting with block lanugages then transition to text so they understand fundamental practices before actually writing their own.
* **Spaced repetition** - reminding students of content they have previously covered to reinforce their knowledge retention of that content.
* **Ontology** - the formal naming and definition of catagories, properties and relations between concepts. 
* **Epistemology** - the theory of knowledge, how do we go about aquiring knowledge. Through logic? Through intuition?
* **Autoethnography** - A kind of qualtative research where the writer is the primary subject in the research. My journey through teacher training is going to be autoentographic.
* **Cognitive Bias** - we must be aware that we have our own biases developed through our own experiences in life. For example
  * Confirmation bias - wanting to get our own view on a problem confirmed and not considering the other side of the argument properly.
  * Survivor bias - school worked for us so it should work for everyone, not true perhaps for people from backgrounds where they have less faith in the education system.
  * Societal bias - biases enforced upon us from society like steryotypes of certain people.
  * Sunk cost phallacy - if you have sunk resources into something you are going to be more invested in its outcome.
  * Emotional bias - favouring people that we connect to more or have more in common with.

* Critical analysis of arguments and research is the key to doing well academically. Reflect on both sides of an argument then say why you agree with one of them and explain it. Just giving one side will not suffice. Refer to **recent** and international journals.
* Poster presentations should be viewed as a visualsied abstract. Short, succinct but gets the point across without getting bogged down by details. Details can be included alongside visual aids!
