# Notes From Lectures

### Induction 2a (14/09/2020) 
* 3 Main takeaway points from induction session 2a:
  * What it means to be a professional and what professionalism means.
  * The importance of "contracting" with your mentor in school so that both parties understand what is expected of the relationship.
  * The role of both the mentor and mentee in the relationship, both work as a partnership and should be equally respectfull and attentive.

### Subject Pedagogy 2 (14/09/2020)
* We explored how different parties involved in the education system have different view points:
    * Students expect to be able to understand everything and be experts in the field easily. - Setting expectations in the classroom will be important here so that students understand that they are starting at the bottom and will not be creating AAA games at the end of the course.
    * Society expects you to train people to be workers and use technology effectively. - This links to the Rotten STEM article where maybe some of the deeper knowledge is being lost as it does not directly impact society in an economic point of view.
    * As teachers we expect to prepare the students for the future and provide them with the tools they will need in life, specifically within the field of computer science. - I need to understand that I will have some bias as to which areas of computing I will focus my teaching on, but still need to teach the entire curriculum fairly.
