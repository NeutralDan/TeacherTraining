# Archived/Completed Reflections & Actions

### Workflow Solution (11/09/2020)
* Allan introduced Markdown files stored on GitHub as a workflow solution, this sounds like a great idea so i'm going to investigate and try to setup my own solution. 
    * This worked great! The 2 Markdown documents I have setup and linked to my GitHub repository should make it easy for Allan and my colleagues to see my reflections!#

### Screen Capture (11/09/2020)
* Allan gave some examples of software that are easy to use to enable us to capture our screens and webcams/microphones. This will be useful for online teaching solutions.
    * Added the Screencastify extension to Google Chrome that is very simple to use and can upload my screen captures/vlogs straight to youtube! I have also setup a private youtube channel for the teacher training course where I can post videos and link Allan and colleagues to.

### Demo my screen capture experience! (11/09/2020)
* Allan has requested a short video showing how I have decided to construct my reflections workflow for this year, this will get me to test out my screen capture skills and give me an idea of what recording a lesson for online learning would be like!
    * I have done it! You can follow [This link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0rJ7j4MGhg&t=2s&ab_channel=DanWTeacherTraining) to see a demo of my workflow solution!

### Previous Students Reflections (11/09/2020)
* Allan has provided a link where we can read comments from previous students about the course, these should give me some insight about what to expect from this year.
    * After reading through these comments, I can see where these previous students have found difficulties in their ITT year. There is some good advice in here for how to not get overwhelmed with the workload from the university and how to get more comfortable when teaching a class for the first time. This has helped me set some expectations about what my first steps into my school placement might be like! If I ever want to refer back to these comments, [they can be found here](https://github.com/calaldees/teachingWorkshops/blob/master/teacherTraining/_advice_from_past_students.md)
