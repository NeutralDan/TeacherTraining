# Archived/Completed Reflections & Actions

### Workflow Solution (11/09/2020)
* Allan introduced Markdown files stored on GitHub as a workflow solution, this sounds like a great idea so i'm going to investigate and try to setup my own solution. 
    * This worked great! The 2 Markdown documents I have setup and linked to my GitHub repository should make it easy for Allan and my colleagues to see my reflections!#

### Screen Capture (11/09/2020)
* Allan gave some examples of software that are easy to use to enable us to capture our screens and webcams/microphones. This will be useful for online teaching solutions.
    * Added the Screencastify extension to Google Chrome that is very simple to use and can upload my screen captures/vlogs straight to youtube! I have also setup a private youtube channel for the teacher training course where I can post videos and link Allan and colleagues to.

### Demo my screen capture experience! (11/09/2020)
* Allan has requested a short video showing how I have decided to construct my reflections workflow for this year, this will get me to test out my screen capture skills and give me an idea of what recording a lesson for online learning would be like!
    * I have done it! You can follow [This link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0rJ7j4MGhg&t=2s&ab_channel=DanWTeacherTraining) to see a demo of my workflow solution!
