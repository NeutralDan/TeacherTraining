# SP10 - Formative Assessment

## Dylan William: What do we mean by Assessment for Learning? 

* Can you elaborate on students as owners of their own learning?
> Having a refelctive approach to their learning - self assessment a way to achieve this.
> Meta cognintion, managaing their emotional response to their learning failures.
> Students improve their learning much more effectively when they understand their goals, where they currently are and how to improve. This mindset will help students direct their own learning more. 

* Can you elaborate on students are learning resources for one another
> Peer assessment - supporting each other as learners.
> Meta cognintion between students.
> Assessing another students work using rubrics or other non quantitative forms of marking will assist students in developing a healthy learning mindset. They can then share this mindset with other students to reinforce it.

* What does Dylan mean when he says view from the rear view mirror?
> Using grades to figure out what was wrong with the assignment they just completed is useless - that assignment has been done already. Assessment for learning should be done on a lesson by lesson basis to improve learning for the students. 

* What is the maximum number of times you should perform formative assessment?
> Not more often than once a minuite. Keep checking that the students are understanding and correct their learning if they are struggling.

## Inside the Black Box (Black and Wiliam, 1998)

* How could we train pupils to self assess their work? - What skills, support, time, resources would they need to do this?
> Improve their self esteem - comment on how to improve their work rather than comparer their work to their peers. Low achieving students will be hesitant to ask questions due to fear of failure, building their confidence by not comparing them to others will improve their learning dramatically.
> Providing students with a clear view of their targets that their work should be aiming to achieve can help promote healthy self assessment. If they know what their work should include they can more easily reflect on the work they have done. 

* How do we give feedback? - What are the benefits/problems of verbal, written, digital?
> Three part feedback: What is the goal, where is the student currently, what can they do to improve. All 3 parts must be understood by the student in order to get cohesive improvement in their work. 
> Verbal feedback is temporary, but very personal. Written feedback can be easily reflected upon but does not have as great of an impact. Digital feedback is very impersonal and can often be overlooked by students as does not leave much room for bespoke reflection.

* How will students convey their understanding to you?
> Through discussion, observing activities or marking written work can all be ways to gain an understanding of the students learning. Some students will have unorthodox methods of of thinking problems through, if this is thoughtfull and achieving the goals of the Learning Objectives then this is not necessarily a bad thing. 

* Can you give examples of feedback (phrases/sentences) that would prompt a student to improve? (we will look as group to see if we can wordsmith these)
> Allowing a pause for thought when asking questions can help students with their train of thoughts. A 30 second/minuite of thinking time after asking a difficult question can give students the chance to think out what to say and then convey their thoughts more clearly. Quick fact check questions do not promote learning across the whole classroom - the students that can think of the answers fast will answer most of the time and the ones that need more time will not try as often. 
> Feedback should give specific guidance on strengths and weaknesses (preferably without an overall mark so students cannot compare grades)

* How would you set regular homework + give meaningly feedback (timely) + observe that the feedback was actioned/had-impact
> Frequent, short tests are more impactful than infrequent long ones. Diagnostic questions can also improve the impactful nature of these short tests so the feedback can be more directed. 
> Perhaps quick 10 questions quizzes using diagnostic questions as a plenary or homework task could achieve this. The diagnostic nature of the questions could make feedback bespoke for the students as well as being easy to produce due to understanding their weaknesses based on the responses. This feedback could then be delivered as part of a starter task to get students thinking about their work and self assessing their learning.

5 Key formative assessment strategies:
* Clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
* Engineering effective classroom discussions and activities
* Providing feedback that moves learning forward
* Activating learners as instructional resources for one another
* Activating learners as owners of their own learning

> Using these strategies, students made an additional 2 months' progress compared to a control group. These strategies benefited the lower ability students more so than the more advanced learners.
> Younger students more recepitve to the new learning style - older students too ingrained in the grade attainment system to see the benefits.

## T.I.M.E (Craig 'n' Dave)

* Stands for Try, Investigate, Make and Evaluate. This is about teaching programming and is a way to get the students to work at their own pace and evaluate their own work, while scaffolding their understanding of programming concepts.
* "The role of the teacher is to maintain pace, provide individual interventions when students are stuck, review completed objectives and track progress." This method of teaching allows for more individual teacher to student intervention to assist learning and push high achievers. 
* This approach utilises the same ideals as formative assessment, promoting students to become owners of their own learning and teaching them how to effectively use self assessment.
