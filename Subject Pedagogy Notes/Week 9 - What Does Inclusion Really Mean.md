### Tech to Teach With - Exploration Task

Micro:bit
* Coded using block language simliar to scratch - easy to build upon existing knowledge and transfer scratch skills to robotics. 7
* Range of sensors to make simple robitic machines. (temperature, acelerometer, light etc...)
* Could be used in classroom projects. Microbits can interact with each other. Make a messaging system? Various games? Indvidual students can do individual projects on what they are interested in. 

> For differentiating tasks using these microbits, the way that the multiple languages work within the device could be very useful. Lower ability students will find the block language easier to understand as its much clearer to follow visually when you're unfamilliar with a language. Alternatviely, the ability to write in Javascript or Python allows the AMA to engage by using the text based languages to explore programming syntax and techniques.
> You could also use this technology to show how written code works exatly like block code. Maybe a quiz where you show the students a short piece of code in blocks, and ask them to try and convert it to Python (or visa versa). This would be good for scaffolding when learning text based languages after having been taught something like scratch. 
> Group or pair tasks would work great with a class set of these devices. AMA students could also pair up to design some really detailed and intricate projects. Class projects to make games, messaging systems etc... All would work well.

Tinker CAD
* Useful for understanding circuits - potentially more useful in the physics classroom? 
* Could be used for practice before making their own robots? Useful stepping stone to real world electronics. Has examples of Arduino breadboards so can transition to making real Arduino powered devices. 
* Can also be used to practice code for the devices - can see code in both block and text language so differentiated for different ablities. 
* If not able to get a class set of Arduino devices, students can create a program and then that can be tested by running it on a single device that the teacher has. Good for showing real world application of code and can link to how other things operate. 
* Can really push high achieving students - limits of what they can create are nearly endless. 

Virtual Machines
* Good for school use as don't require technicians to install new software for student use.
* Accessible for motivated students - maybe slightly overcomplicated for low ability students, especially working from home
* Easily manageable by teacher for networking activities that would not be possible without lots of hardware being purchased by school. 


AMA - Academically More Able
* Interesting session delving into the do's and do not's of how to provide extension tasks and how to give praise to students doing well.
* How to spot the AMA children before you get to know them? - Acutally lots of vaired ways to spot them! (Test results, distracted etc...)
* Extension tasks should be more open ended - allow the AMA students to explore the topic and find out where it leads them!
