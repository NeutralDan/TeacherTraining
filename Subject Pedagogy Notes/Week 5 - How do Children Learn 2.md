## R4P

### Lesson Planning Tips
* Get to know your students, basic knowledge of where they are in the curriculum is of course neccessary but any additional information can help when it comes to teaching that class. Ask other teachers for additional advice, e.g. any children with SEN or who are ahead or behind the rest of the class.
* Keep the objectives of the lesson simple, don't over plan the lesson with too many activities or too many topics. 
* Consider these 4 key questions when planning a lesson to focus on the students learning:
  * Where are the students starting from?
  * Where do you want the students to get to?
  * How will you know when they are there?
  * How can you best help them get there?
* Don't try and improve and implement everything I have learned on the first lesson, step by step build up the techniques neccessary to becoming a good teacher. 

### Lesson Obs - Year 9 Economics
Group lesson on the product life cycle
* No recap of previous knowledge! No building on previous knowledge!
* Group activity doing some blind exploration of where products are located in their life cycle, self directed learning through discussion with their groups. Teacher can walk around and check on groups to make sure they are understanding the task. 
* Students asked to demonstrate knowledge from the disscussion task on the board. 
* Worksheet the students are asked to fill out throughout the lesson as they learn the different stages of the life cycle. 
* Getting students to recap the tasks before performing them ensures that the task has been understood. 
* Passing a poster around the groups getting them to collaborate on them to share ideas between groups. This also creates more time for the teacher to discuss with groups to guide them in their thinking and make sure everything is being understood. 
* Critical analysis of the ideas posed by the other groups to try and find possible problems, this gets the students to question what they are being told rather than just accepting it as fact. 
* Getting the students to explain how they know that they have learnt the aims of the lesson. Demonstrated by explaining it to the people around them.
