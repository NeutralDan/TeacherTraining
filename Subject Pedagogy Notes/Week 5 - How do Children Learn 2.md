# Week 5 - How do Children Learn 2
---

## R4P

### Lesson Planning Tips
* Get to know your students, basic knowledge of where they are in the curriculum is of course neccessary but any additional information can help when it comes to teaching that class. Ask other teachers for additional advice, e.g. any children with SEN or who are ahead or behind the rest of the class.
* Keep the objectives of the lesson simple, don't over plan the lesson with too many activities or too many topics. 
* Consider these 4 key questions when planning a lesson to focus on the students learning:
  * Where are the students starting from?
  * Where do you want the students to get to?
  * How will you know when they are there?
  * How can you best help them get there?
* Don't try and improve and implement everything I have learned on the first lesson, step by step build up the techniques neccessary to becoming a good teacher. 

### Lesson Obs - Year 9 Economics
Group lesson on the product life cycle
* No recap of previous knowledge! No building on previous knowledge!
* Group activity doing some blind exploration of where products are located in their life cycle, self directed learning through discussion with their groups. Teacher can walk around and check on groups to make sure they are understanding the task. 
* Students asked to demonstrate knowledge from the disscussion task on the board. 
* Worksheet the students are asked to fill out throughout the lesson as they learn the different stages of the life cycle. 
* Getting students to recap the tasks before performing them ensures that the task has been understood. 
* Passing a poster around the groups getting them to collaborate on them to share ideas between groups. This also creates more time for the teacher to discuss with groups to guide them in their thinking and make sure everything is being understood. 
* Critical analysis of the ideas posed by the other groups to try and find possible problems, this gets the students to question what they are being told rather than just accepting it as fact. 
* Getting the students to explain how they know that they have learnt the aims of the lesson. Demonstrated by explaining it to the people around them.

## SP6 - Behaviour for Learning

* 3 Main factors that have an influence on behaviour: Emotional, Social and Cognative. These 3 areas are where issues tend to stem from, though those issues are varied. 
* One big idea with managing a childs behaviour is to look at their emotional state as a bucket. When the bucket gets too full theres no room for anything else. This is similar to the cognative load theory
* There is an attention window. Too many stimuli and the children will not pay attention, too little and they will day dream. Keeping the lesson in this window is the key to keeping their attention.
* Routines are key for managing classroom behaviours and ensuring that the least time possible is wasted on routine tasks. 
* Non-generic praise is good for keeping motivation up. Generic praise is not as effective.
* Responding to poor behaviour should be as minimal as possible to avoid interrupting the flow of the lesson and causing more issues. Start with simple things like proximity to the problem before even asking them to stop it. 
* Consistency is key to making the students think about their actions. If you set a detention then fail to enforce it, children will think they can get away with it in the future. 

### Possible Misbehaviours
* Calling out without raising a hand
* Chatting with peers when not directed to
* Not being focused on the tasks
* Not following basic routines 
* Causing disruptions for other students

What does this behaviour mean? Why are they doing it?

### Possible Positive Behaviours 
* Engaging with discussions
* Focused attention on the tasks
* Asking further questions 

Some solutions for these problems could be setting better expectations of behaviour and trying to stop behavioural problems before they become an issue through small steps. This could include little things like simply standing near the students that are talking or a quick hand gesture. If the behaviour becomes more of a problem then something more major like a detention or at least the threat of one may be neccessary but only if carried out in a constructive manner. 

## Notes from Collaborate Session
* Reinforced the idea of the relationship triangle, Self, Others and the Curriculum are where most of the problems with behaviour come from. 
* Good behaviour needs to be actively taught, students may not know instinctively the ways you want them to behave during lessons. 
* Understanding your students and their needs goes a long way to knowing how to get them to behave and will help in specific scenarios with students they understand better. 
* The "Hidden Curriculum" where we are inadvertently teaching students things like how to behave in society and act towards others. 
* Make as much of the communication between you and the students non-verbal to not disrupt the lesson and mindsets of the students.  
* The classroom is your space and you set the rules for it. You need to dominate the space so that the students understand that you are in charge. The entrance to the classroom is the best time to do this. Either getting students to line up and behave before entering or come into the room and start getting students to set the room up how you want it (Opening windows, moving desks etc).
* The students are not your friends, you can get on with them in an academic setting but they are students you are teaching and children that can and will cause trouble.
