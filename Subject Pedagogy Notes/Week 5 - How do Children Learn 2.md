# Week 5 - How do Children Learn 2

## R4P

### Lesson Planning for My First Few Lessons
* Get to know your students, basic knowledge of where they are in the curriculum is of course neccessary but any additional information can help when it comes to teaching that class. Ask other teachers for additional advice, e.g. any children with SEN or who are ahead or behind the rest of the class.
* Keep the objectives of the lesson simple, don't over plan the lesson with too many activities or too many topics. 
* Consider these 4 key questions when planning a lesson to focus on the students learning:
  * Where are the students starting from?
  * Where do you want the students to get to?
  * How will you know when they are there?
  * How can you best help them get there?
* Don't try and improve and implement everything I have learned on the first lesson, step by step build up the techniques neccessary to becoming a good teacher.
