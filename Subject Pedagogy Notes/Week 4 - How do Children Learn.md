## R4P Activities

### Epistemic Insight
* Epistemic Insight is the theory of providing students with the idea to approach problems from points of view other than that of their subject discipline. This means getting mathematicians and computer scientists to think like artists or historians to get a new perspective of a problem that may help them arrive at a better conclusion to the problem.     

### Cognative Load Theory
* This is the theory that there is only so much new information the brain can hold for processing before any more new information is not stored at all. New information enters the brain and is processed according to what existing information exists in the students long term memory. This infomation is sorted into "schemas" where related topics are grouped together to form and organised memory structure. While the new information is being processed into these schemas, a large assault of information is wasted on the students as theyre brain is too busy sorting other information. This is known as cognative overload. 

### Lesson Observation
* [Lesson Obseration Sheet can be found here.](https://github.com/NeutralDan/TeacherTraining/blob/master/Subject%20Pedagogy%20Notes/Lesson%20Obs%20Week%204%20R4P.docx?raw=true)
* Lots of good techniques demonstrated for keeping the students attention and ensuring they are learning information for themselves interactively.
