### Inclusive Practice

* Teachers are "duty-bound" to include all students no matter their needs, backgrounds or anything else. This gives us certain responsibilities when it comes to working with SEN students and helping them access the learning resources we provide.
* The need to work with all students brings into discussion the role of certain schools like single sex, grammar, or special needs schools. Do these work towards the goal of a inclusive learning society? Are they instead needed to provide adequate education for these different groups and allow more effective teaching as a community?
* Resources that we create need to be accessible to all members of the learning cohort it is available to. There are many metrics available to us that we can call upon to make sure that we are fulfilling this requirement.
