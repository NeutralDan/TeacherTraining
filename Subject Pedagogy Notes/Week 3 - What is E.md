## Notes from the School Direct Students
---

* Form time contains quite alot of work load, his example was briefing the cohort on "themes of the week" like LGBT+ and european languages. This added pastoral care was something I havent considered yet but will be a good oportunity to enage with the students less formally. 
* Professional development - informing the teachers and student teachers on how to organise workflows for marking and lesson planning. Workshops on new teaching ideas and methods are delivered. Great for keeping existing teachers up to date and training student teachers in the proven ways of managing the huge workload!
* Staff meetings where issues are raised, Matthew mentioned updates like what they have to catch up on due to covid closures leaving gaps in student knowledge. 
* Don't be afraid to admit you don't fully know something - make it a task for the room to investigate!
* Repetition of previous lessons is great for engaging students and helping them retaining the knowledge they have been taught. 
* Behaviour control works well little and often, a quick shush then moving on does well without letting it get out of control. Relationships with the students are key to keeping control and respect.

## Schemes of work

* These are ways of laying out the curriculum into manageable chunks and lesson plans. Usefull for planning the reinforcement of knowledge over time and making sure the curriculum has been covered in its entirety.   
* [interactiveclassroom.net](interactiveclassroom.net) has some great examples of a well laid out scheme of work that breaks down the whole curriculum into lesson objectives for each lesson. Definitely use this for inspiration when planning lessons. 

### Task:
* How to topics in schemes of work map to the curriculum?
  * They seem to flow between topics that are connected, as well as through larger topics that will be built upon in following years. 
* What are the links between topics for year 1, 2, 3?
  * They have large topics repeated and each year builds upon similar knowledge from the year before, Scratch -> text based programming for example. 
* What similarities/differences are there between the schemes of work?
  * Most schemes of work contain the same topics and a similar order to when they are taught. The differences come in the level of detail that they have been planned in. Some just give the order of topics and the key points to teach, others have lesson plans and objectives as well!
* Other than the sequence of content, what other teaching resources are provided?
  * There are things like assessment criteria, suggested homework activities, and even in some cases power point files containing suggested lesson activities and progression for each topic. 
* Would you be able to teach any of these units with the resources provided?
  * Without adding some of my own resources and fully understanding the available resources it would be difficult, but these schemes of work do provide a good starting point to make the task of teaching an entire curriculum seem less daunting. Having a struture to the subject content and a place to start would make teaching without prior experience much easier.

## Lesson Planning

* Importance of context and physical examples when planning tasks for students. What makes what they are being taught relevant to real-world scenarios.
