# Week 6 - How do Children Learn 3

## R4P

### Behaviour in the Classroom
Attention Seekers - 
* If class members are disruptive, try to not divert attention to the rest of the class as they may respond to the negative attention.
* There are 3 teaching distances, from the front for general teaching and approval, up close for quiet one to one discussion and a middle ground where attention is focused on a group of people. The short distance teaching "whispers" should be directed to specific disruptive students to address them without giving them the attention they are trying to gain. 

Discipline Crisis?
* Debate takes place in 2005, argument as to if the behaviour of children was a huge problem then, is 
the problem worse now? 
* Consistency seems to be the key in good behaivour, if the studnets are aware of what happens in response to bad behaviour then they wont behave badly in the first place. 
* The majority of teachers seem to think the main issue with childrens behaviour lies with the lack of parental guidance on how to behave. There may also be some responsibilty on the teachers to provide engaging classrooms that make the students want to behave in.
* Some blame lies with the curriculum, the students that are causing issues in the classroom may not have the tools necessary to learn what is being taught. More support for students that need more basic tools could help with these students.

## SP7

Assignment - maybe look at assessment tools for computing, tests, coursework, online tools etc... formative throughout the year and end of year exams

Micro teach - Try to focus more on the aim of the lesson. Tried teaching too much in 20 minuites, should have just expanded on earlier tasks rather than introducing new ideas.
