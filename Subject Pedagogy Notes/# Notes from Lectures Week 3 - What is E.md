## Notes from the School Direct Students
---

* Form time contains quite alot of work load, his example was briefing the cohort on "themes of the week" like LGBT+ and european languages. This added pastoral care was something I havent considered yet but will be a good oportunity to enage with the students less formally. 
* Professional development - informing the teachers and student teachers on how to organise workflows for marking and lesson planning. Workshops on new teaching ideas and methods are delivered. Great for keeping existing teachers up to date and training student teachers in the proven ways of managing the huge workload!
* Staff meetings where issues are raised, Matthew mentioned updates like what they have to catch up on due to covid closures leaving gaps in student knowledge. 
* Don't be afraid to admit you don't fully know something - make it a task for the room to investigate!
* Repetition of previous lessons is great for engaging students and helping them retaining the knowledge they have been taught. 
* Behaviour control works well little and often, a quick shush then moving on does well without letting it get out of control.
