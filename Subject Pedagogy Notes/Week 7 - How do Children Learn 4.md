We covered diagnostic questions and how they can be used to tell where students misconceptions lie with understanding a topic.
* Each answer to a diagnostic question should only lead to one mistake in the students understanding. This is so us teachers best know how to assist the students that choose that answer. 
* There should not be any wrong answers that do not inform us of why they have chosen that answer, this is useless information and does not help us determine how to help that student.
* There should be only one correct answer.
* The questions should be quick to answer and ideally not be multi-step questions.
