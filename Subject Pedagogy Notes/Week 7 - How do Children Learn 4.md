### Diagnostic Questions

We covered diagnostic questions and how they can be used to tell where students misconceptions lie with understanding a topic.
* Each answer to a diagnostic question should only lead to one mistake in the students understanding. This is so us teachers best know how to assist the students that choose that answer. 
* There should not be any wrong answers that do not inform us of why they have chosen that answer, this is useless information and does not help us determine how to help that student.
* There should be only one correct answer.
* The questions should be quick to answer and ideally not be multi-step questions. 

### PRIMM

PRIMM is a method of teaching students programming skills. It strutures the understanding of how algorithms function in a way that breaks this process down into manageable chunks. 

> PREDICT-RUN-INVESTIGATE-MODIFY-MAKE.

* This approach is heavily scaffolded to allow learners to understand the separate    concepts more easily. By doing this you will need to spend less time helping scaffold for individual students and can more effectively progress through the material. 
* The investigate stage is perhaps the most important, getting the students to fully understand how an algorithm functions by following variable through, commenting code and explaining to others can heavily reinforce the learning of those techinuqes.

### Meta-Cognition

* Using metacognitive strategies means getting students to understand their own learning process. By assisting students in understanding their own learning methods and where their strengths and weakenesses lie, they can more effectively go about learning material in a way which suits them. 
* Self and peer assessment would be useful methods in promoting metacognative learning. They will learn which areas they perform well in and where they need to improve by reviewing their own work. 
* Scaffolding tasks with students allows them to see the thought process behind some of the learning they are struggling with. By breaking the problem down into steps you can help identify the problem area and teaching the students to do that themsleves will allow them to grow their learning techniques.

### Construtivism

* This is the approach to learning where knowledge should be built upon the learners own previous experiences. This is the key idea and suggests that it is easier to build upon previous knowledge and modify the understanding of that knowledge than to build new knowledge bases from scratch. 
* This approach promotes the idea that learning is an active process and not something that can just be dictated. The understanding of information is only achieved through the active involvment in the learning process. 
* All learning is a social activity, education happens between people not individually. 
* Every student has a distinct view point on the information they are learning. Every one will understand the information in different ways as they are building it upon different existing knowledge. - Handy to have multiple approaches to teaching an idea so that these different learners can understand.
